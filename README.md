1. **Average Income Per Purchase by Gender**:  
   - This bar chart shows the average income of customers who purchased bikes (Yes) and those who didn’t (No), segmented by gender (Male, Female). It gives an overview of how income levels vary between those who made a purchase and those who didn’t.

2. **Customer Age Bracket vs Bike Purchase**:  
   - The line graph displays bike purchases categorized by age brackets (Adolescent, Middle Age, and Old). The graph compares the number of customers who purchased bikes (Yes) against those who didn’t (No).

3. **Customer Commute Distance vs Bike Purchase**:  
   - Another line graph that analyzes how commute distance influences bike purchases. The graph segments customers by commute distance ranges (0-1 miles, 1-2 miles, 2-5 miles, 5-10 miles, and More than 10 miles), providing a comparison between those who purchased bikes (Yes) and those who didn’t (No).

Additionally, there are filter options on the left for **Marital Status, Region, and Education**, allowing users to dive deeper into the analysis by segmenting the data based on these variables.

### Key Insights:

1. **Income Influence on Purchases**:  
   - Both males and females with higher average incomes tend to purchase bikes. Males with higher incomes (around 60,124) show a greater tendency to purchase compared to females (around 55,774).

2. **Age Bracket and Purchase Behavior**:  
   - Middle-aged individuals are the largest group of bike buyers, as indicated by the higher orange line (Yes) in this age bracket. Adolescents and older individuals are less likely to purchase bikes.

3. **Commute Distance and Purchases**:  
   - Customers who commute 0-1 miles show the highest likelihood of purchasing bikes. As the commute distance increases, the number of bike purchases declines, particularly beyond 5 miles.

This dashboard allows businesses to identify key customer groups (e.g., middle-aged individuals with higher incomes and shorter commutes) who are more likely to purchase bikes, providing valuable insights for targeted marketing and sales strategies.
